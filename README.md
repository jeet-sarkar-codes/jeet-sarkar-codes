# 👨‍💻 Jeet Sarkar – Software Engineer in Progress | Future AI Security Specialist

Hi, I’m Jeet — currently a Technical Support Engineer I at Dell Technologies, pivoting into software development with purpose and urgency. I’m building real-world tools to bridge the gap between system support, backend development, and secure automation.

## 🔧 What I’m Building
Every project I share is built from scratch to showcase practical, production-relevant skills:

### 🐍 Backend & Scripting
- [**Ticket Log Analyzer**](https://github.com/jeet-sarkar-codes/ticket-log-analyzer): Python CLI tool to scan support logs and summarize issues.
- [**Diagnostic API Service**](https://github.com/jeet-sarkar-codes/diagnostic-api-service): Flask-based microservice simulating system health checks.
- [**Issue Tracker App**](https://github.com/jeet-sarkar-codes/issue-tracker-app): Form-based issue logger using Flask + SQLite backend.
- [**API Client Simulator**](https://github.com/jeet-sarkar-codes/api-client-simulator): Python script that interacts with REST APIs and parses response JSON.
- [**Uptime Visualizer**](https://github.com/jeet-sarkar-codes/uptime-visualizer): Generates system uptime graphs using Matplotlib.
- [**Flask Performance API**](https://github.com/jeet-sarkar-codes/flask-performance-app): Simulates load on Flask endpoints and tracks latency via browser tools.

### 📊 Data & Dashboarding
- [**Power BI Support Dashboard**](https://github.com/jeet-sarkar-codes/powerbi-support-dashboard): Interactive dashboard analyzing support ticket data using KPIs, slicers, and trend visuals.
